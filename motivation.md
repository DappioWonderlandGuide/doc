# Motivation [WIP]

One of the challenges people often talk about when it comes to Solana is its composability. While some programs are open source, majority aren't, making it almost impossible to build projects on Solana with mass adoption potential. Interacting with DeFi or NFTs on Solana shouldn't be hard, which is why Dappio created the Universal Rabbit Hole.

Dappio is dedicated to making Solana easy and bringing top developers into the Solana ecosystem. Our Universal Rabbit Hole provides developers with a plug-and-play framework "gateway" for a basket of Dapps. Versatile enough to accommodate Farm, Vault, money market, and other DeFi needs, Universal Rabbit Hole empowers users to build their ideal projects on Solana.

| TA | Pain Point(Before) | Solution(After) | Example |
| - | - | - | - |
| Protocol Developers | Try to find out how to acquire more TVL and exposure in efficient way| Universal Rabbit Hole provides integration framework for Protocols to build composable service Adapter. | Dappio aggregate more users to increase TVL through Dappio DeFi Platform. |
| DApp Developers | Limited open source from Protocol on Solana; Inefficient to read different types of SDK to build| Universal Rabbit Hole saves time spent reading/trying those protocol SDKs individually. | Easier to build a Zap-in Function(Swap on Jupiter, Add LP on Saber, Staked on Farm pool) and create Auto-compounding vaults on Tulip or Francium |
| End Users | Limited DeFi choice on Solana | More DeFi innovation protocols available, with better user experience on Solana ecosystem | More Protocols on Solana can build on top of Dappio to create the best yields and model for users to choose and earn ideal returns |
